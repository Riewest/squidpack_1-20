# Moving is Tuff

Item Teleportation? Player Teleportation? Who needs 'em.

This pack spawned from the idea that modded minecraft worlds tend to have very localized infrastructure. Making certain aspects of some mods (i.e. Create Trains) a less attractive way to transport items around your world.

By eliminating most easy forms of modded item/player teleportation this pack hopes that players will come up with more creative and entertaining ways of getting items from Point A to Point B.

Several questlines, both static and dynamic, have also been added to incentivize gathering huge amounts of resources. 

## Core Gameplay Changes/Additions
### Changes
  - **End Portals/Strongholds:** We have removed endportals to change the gameplay route to the end.
  - **Changed Recipes:** Several recipes have been changed to make them a bit harder or gate them behind interdimensional travel. 
    - See JEI for AE2, Botania, CC, etc.
  - **Removed Items:** Some items have been removed so as to stick more closely to the theme of *Moving is Tuff*

### Additions/Quests
  - **Large Ore Deposits:**
    - Large ore deposits of Tuff Ores have been added that can be found with the Scanner/Tuff Ores Scanner Module
    - These veins are targeting an average of 1 Million raw ore per vein spread out over ~7500 blocks per vein.
